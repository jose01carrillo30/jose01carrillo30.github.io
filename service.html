                    <h3>The Big Event - 2019</h3>
                    <p>We worked with families in Bryan/College Station area to help with various upkeep and clean up activities. My group was tasked with performing yardwork for a grateful resident and his family. It was an amazing chance to see so many students coming together to improve the area and give back to the community!</p>

                    <p>Volunteered at a local Habitat for Humanity, helping organize their warehouse. It was a large effort and hard work, but it was very rewarding to see how a handful of volunteers can make a dramatic improvement in the course of a day. With the warehouse sorted out, people in need from the community will have better access to the home improvement supplies available to them.</p>

                    <p>We measured and packaged food to be donated to communities in need. I contributed to labeling and sealing the meals, as we all worked in an assembly line fashion. The event also included members not just from Tau Beta Pi, but also other organizations as well. I can't remeber the exact number, but collectively we packaged a lot of meals.</p>
